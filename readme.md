- SOLID
- PSR-2 PHP development standard
- PHPUnit – The PHP Testing Framework
- POO

The laravel framework will be used. And you can see the exemple [here](https://scotch.io/tutorials/a-guide-to-using-eloquent-orm-in-laravel)

## About Laravel 5.4

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:
*** So far the project uses only - Até o momento, o projeto usa apenas:
- [Database ORM Eloquent](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- [Schema Migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Eloquent: Relationships](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/eloquent-relationships#inserting-and-updating-related-models)
- [Database: Seeding](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/seeding)
- [Mocking](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/mocking)

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb combination of simplicity, elegance, and innovation give you tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
